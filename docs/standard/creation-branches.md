# STD - Creation branches

## Objective

Describe what should be the standards to follow to work correctly with github branches.

## Content

- STRIXDEV uses Gitflow, it's branching model, which requires two main branches: "main" and "develop". The main branch contains the stable code that will be released to production, while the development branch contains the code that is currently being worked on. In addition to parent branches, child branches are also used to create new functionality or fix bugs.

- To name a Github branch, you need to follow the github-branches guide.

- To perform any merge to the develop branch, you must request a pull request to another partner of the development team through GitHub.

- Before creating or merging a branch, you must verify that you are working on the most up-to-date versions of them by means of a git pull.
