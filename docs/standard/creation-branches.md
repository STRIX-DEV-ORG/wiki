-STRIXDEV uses Gitflow, it's branching model, which requires two main branches: "main" and "develop". The main branch contains the stable code that will be released to production, while the development branch contains the code that is currently being worked on. In addition to parent branches, child branches are also used to create new functionality or fix bugs.
