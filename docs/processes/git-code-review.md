### 1.Introduction

Code reviews play a crucial role in maintaining code quality and fostering collaboration among team members. This document outlines the process and best practices for conducting effective code reviews.

### 2. Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code in an MR or PR, consider the following aspects:

#### Code Quality:
- Code follows the established coding standards.
- Variable and function names are clear and descriptive.
- Code is modular and follows a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach.
- Code complexity is reasonable, and complex logic is well-documented.

#### Testing:
- Code changes include unit tests that cover new functionality.
- Existing unit tests are not broken by the proposed changes.
- Edge cases and error scenarios are covered by tests.
- If applicable, integration tests and end-to-end tests are included.

#### General Code Standards:
- The code is consistent with the project's overall architecture.
- Coding conventions, such as indentation and formatting, are followed.
- No commented-out code is present in the final submission.
- Error handling is implemented appropriately.
- No hardcoded values unless if it require it.

### 3. Pro Tips for Effective Code Reviews

Offer specific feedback that helps the developer understand the issue and suggests improvements.

#### I. Be Respectful and Positive
Maintain a positive and respectful tone in your comments, fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment.

#### II. Consider the Bigger Picture
Understand the context of the changes and how they fit into the overall project goals.

#### III. Address Security Concerns
