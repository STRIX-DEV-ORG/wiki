### General Principles

- Collaborators must comply with the weekly working hours established.
- Collaborators must register their working hours and activities carried out in an accurate and transparent manner, using tools suggested or authorized by STRIXDEV, and attaching the evidence that support their statement.
- The assigned Team Lead must verify that the hours and activities declared are consistent with the objectives or goals of the project or activity assigned, as well as with the evidence presented.
- STRIXDEV will measure the performance of collaborators according to a defined criteria and indicators, based on the hours and activities registered, as well as recognize and reward good performance.

### Working with a team

- All STRIXDEV collaborators must respect their collegues time and schedule, avoiding being late, leaving early or being absent without justification, this applies for any appointment or activity that has been previously scheduled.
- Employees can request permits or licenses for personal, medical or legal reasons, following the procedure established by STRIXDEV and presenting the required documents.
- Although the schedule is open, the work team can plan the weekly hours that best suit their needs and preferences, as long as the objectives or goals of the project or dedicated activity are met.
- Not a single team member should work extra hours; if this happens, you must communicate this event to your Team Lead so the working plan is modified.

### Reporting hours and activities

- The minimum register time for any activity is 30 minutes.
- If the activity that has been realized is less than 30 minutes long, the collaborator must accumulate this activity with other ones, so it matches the minimum register time.
- If there is any doubt about what activities can be reported as part of your time report, you must contact your Team Lead.
- If there is any doubt about the evidence you can provide to support your working hours, you must contact your Team Lead.
