# POL - Working tasks

## Objective

To establish standards and procedures to regulate the work tasks of the STRIXDEV collaborators.

## Content

### General Principles

- Collaborators are encouraged to fulfill the tasks they select, as their income is linked to task completion.

-  Collaborators must register their tasks and the time spent on them accurately and transparently, using tools suggested or authorized by STRIXDEV. This won't have any impact on of any kind, but will be usefull for future plannings and stimations.

- The assigned Team Lead must verify that the tasks and time declared are consistent with the objectives or goals of the project or activity assigned, as well as with the evidence presented.

- Team members can perform extra tasks, keeping in mind that each member has a predetermined amount of money allocated per period. If there is leftover money from that budget, the Team Lead will decide whether to pay for the extra tasks in that spring.

### Working with a Team

- All STRIXDEV collaborators must respect their colleagues' time and schedule, avoiding lateness, early departure, or being absent without justification. This applies to any appointment or activity that has been previously scheduled.

- Collaborators can request permits or licenses for personal, medical, or legal reasons, following the procedure established by STRIXDEV.

- Although the schedule is open, the work team can plan the weekly tasks and hours that best suit their needs and preferences, as long as the objectives or goals of the project or dedicated activity are met.

### Reporting tasks and activities

- The minimum time for registering any task is 30 minutes.

- If the task that has been completed is less than 30 minutes, the collaborator must accumulate this task with others to match the minimum registration time.

- If there is any doubt about what tasks can be reported as part of your task report, you must contact your Team Lead.

- If there is any doubt about the evidence you can provide to support your working tasks, you must contact your Team Lead.
